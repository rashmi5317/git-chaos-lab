git# 👩‍🔧 Git Like a Pro: Real-World Conflict & Chaos Lab

Welcome to the **Git Chaos Lab** — a hands-on workshop built around real-world Git disasters.  
Whether you're just starting or have yelled at `git reset --hard` one too many times, this repo will guide you from survival to mastery.

---

## 🧭 What You’ll Learn

- Everyday Git workflows: branching, pushing, rebasing
- How Git works under the hood (DAG, HEAD, refs, reflog)
- Advanced techniques: resolving conflicts, cherry-picking, rebase vs merge
- Recovery skills for common disasters

---

## 🚦 Workshop Flow

1. ✅ **Warm-up**: Practice Git basics  
   → `git checkout lab0-git-flow`
   
2. 🧠 **Git Internals & DAG Playground**  
   → `git checkout lab-dag-playground`

3. 💥 **Advanced Chaos Labs**  
   → Choose any lab below (each is its own branch)
